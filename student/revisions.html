                                all of these media objects went through several revisions, as i tried to cajole
                                my technological difficulties and thematic confusion into something actually coherent.
                                i would like to give special thanks to my peer reviewers and instructors
                                for providing actionable feedback and to the transfer and international students
                                i consulted for being upfront about their experiences and how they'd like to see
                                them represented.
                            </p>

                    <div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="visual-object-body">
                        <p>my code for the data visualizations was written in <a href="https://observablehq.com">Observable</a> using the D3.js library and
                        the visuals were all generated straight from a subset of federal outstanding loan data.</p>
                        <p>my first draft was actually just the bar chart race graph, with the label for Perkins loans hidden
                            and no actual animation title. the code for generating the graph was prominently featured, so viewers
                            could play around with the visualization if they were curious.
                        </p>
                        <p>my second draft included two scaled donut charts, but they weren't clearly labeled and the draft didn't have a lot of
                            context.
                        </p>
                        <p>my third draft—well, i spent five hours trying to get an if-statement to work in D3, which has a declarative syntax and wouldn't let me refer
                            to the object i needed to if i included one-too-many parentheses pairs. (also, i couldn't compare strings properly? still haven't figured
                            that one out.)
                            somehow, i managed to get an if-statement working to make
                            the perkins loan data legible in the bar chart race graph. then, i modified my donut chart code to automatically
                            move labels to be legible, and matched up the color schemes. finally, i embedded all the charts and added more context.

                    <div>

                    <div id="interactive-object-body">
                        <p>i wrote the all three drafts of my story in <a href="https://inklewriter.com/">inklewriter</a>for quick prototyping. shoutout to the map function for showing me what loose ends i needed to tie up.</p>
                        <p>my first draft was based on the frustrations i've had balancing work and school, along with the intricacies
                            of the FAFSA and student loans. however, i only wrote out the first semester of the player's journey, since
                            i didn't have a concrete idea for how i wanted to tackle the rest of college or the stress that would build up.
                        </p>
                        <p>after talking to some older students, i fleshed out my second draft with more content re: community college
                            and the culture shock and bewilderment that often comes with transferring to a 4-year-university. there are a lot of resources on
                            university campuses, but the students who would need them most often have no idea that they're there, or find them late.
                        </p>
                        <p>i wanted to bring the focus of my final draft back around to the consequences of having to take on student loans on
                            top of being an independent student. money can't buy happiness, but if you don't have money on hand, it's
                            far easier to burn yourself out and put yourself in an even worse situation.
                        </p>
                        <p>after i finished my final draft, i exported my work file into ink, which has an option to 'publish to web'. i then 
                            tweaked the styling to match my overall website and embedded it into the interactive fiction page. </p>

                    </div>
                    <div id="analog-object-body"><p>the analog object was probably the hardest for me to nail down. my first draft was just a mask with fabric
                        and paper glued on, but people were confused as to the connection between a mask and student debt, so i added a little cardboard "cap"
                        and threaded it with a shoelace so i could actually wear it. it looked terrifying, but still wasn't as thematically tied into the rest of my
                        portfolio as i would have liked.
                    </p>
                    <p>so i ordered a diploma holder off amazon, pulled out my trusty fountain pen and ink, and used <a href="https://www.fontspace.com/cloister-black-font-f1997">cloister black</a>as a
                    font reference and made my own sardonic diploma. and then i splattered ink everywhere, because it felt appropriate.</p>
